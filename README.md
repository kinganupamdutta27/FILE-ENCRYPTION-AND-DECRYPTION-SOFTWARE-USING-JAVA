# FILE-ENCRYPTION-AND-DECRYPTION-SOFTWARE-USING-JAVA
The "Java Secure Files" project is a simple desktop application designed to provide users with the ability to encrypt and decrypt their files using a password-based encryption technique. The application offers an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for a seamless user experience.

Key Features:

File Encryption and Decryption: The project allows users to encrypt and decrypt their files securely. Users can select any file from their system and provide a password (key) for encryption or decryption.

Password-Based Encryption: The encryption and decryption process is performed based on a user-provided key. The application XORs each byte of the file with the key, offering a basic yet effective level of security.

User-Friendly Interface: The GUI is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate. It includes informative labels, image icons, and input fields that guide users through the encryption and decryption process.

Error Handling: The application incorporates proper error handling to ensure a smooth user experience. In case of any exceptions or incorrect inputs, the user is presented with meaningful error messages.

Stylish Interface: The GUI is enhanced with stylish components, such as round-cornered buttons and centered image icons, to create an aesthetically pleasing visual experience.

How to Use:

Welcome Screen: Upon launching the application, users are greeted with a welcome message, introducing them to the functionalities of the program.

Encryption Process: To encrypt a file, users can follow these steps:

Click on the "Select File" button to choose the file they wish to encrypt.
Enter a numeric password (key) in the provided text field.
Click on the "Encrypt" button to initiate the encryption process.
Decryption Process: To decrypt an encrypted file, users can follow these steps:

Click on the "Select File" button to choose the encrypted file they wish to decrypt.
Enter the correct numeric password (key) used during encryption in the provided text field.
Click on the "Decrypt" button to start the decryption process.
Error Handling: In case of any issues, such as incorrect passwords or file selection errors, the application displays error messages to guide users on resolving the problem.

Project Purpose:
The "Java Secure Files" project serves as an educational example of file encryption and decryption using a simple password-based technique. It demonstrates how to create a Java Swing-based desktop application with a user-friendly interface and basic encryption capabilities.

While this project provides a basic level of encryption, it is important to note that real-world security applications require more robust encryption algorithms and stronger key management practices. The project is intended to serve as a starting point for learning and experimentation with file encryption in Java.

The "Java Secure Files" project is primarily developed using the Java programming language and Java's Swing library for creating the graphical user interface (GUI). Here are the key technologies and programming languages used in this project:

1. **Java Programming Language:** Java is an object-oriented, high-level programming language known for its platform independence. It is widely used for developing various types of applications, including desktop applications, web applications, and mobile apps.

2. **Java Swing Library:** Swing is a part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC) and is used for creating graphical user interfaces in Java applications. It provides a rich set of GUI components, such as buttons, labels, text fields, and more, to build interactive desktop applications.

3. **File I/O (Input/Output) Operations:** Java's standard libraries are used for performing file input and output operations. In this project, the `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream` classes are used to read and write data to files.

4. **Encryption Algorithm:** The project employs a basic password-based encryption technique using the XOR operation. While XOR is not a recommended encryption algorithm for serious security purposes, it is used here to demonstrate a simple encryption process.

5. **SwingUtilities.invokeLater():** This method is used to ensure that the GUI is created and executed on the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT), which is the thread responsible for handling user interface events in Swing applications.

6. **Java Standard Libraries:** The project relies on various Java standard libraries for handling exceptions, displaying dialog boxes (e.g., `JOptionPane`), and other necessary functionalities.

Overall, the project showcases how to build a simple file encryption and decryption application using Java's Swing library, making it suitable for educational purposes and as a starting point for learning more advanced encryption techniques and Java desktop application development.
